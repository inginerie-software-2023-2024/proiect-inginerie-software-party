## Intermediate deliverable



## Problem statement
The identified problem is linked to the increasing number of stray animals and the challenge potential adopters face in finding the right pet for them. This issue underscores a clear need to streamline the pet adoption process, ensuring that prospective adopters have easy access to information, images, and details about animals available for adoption. We propose the creation of a specialized pet adoption website that functions as a centralized platform for adoption organizations and potential adopters. The beneficiaries of this solution include prospective adopters, adoption organizations, and, most importantly, the animals in need of homes.

## Non-functional requirements
Non-functional Requirements (NFRs) describe the qualities of the system that are not directly linked to its functionality. These attributes focus on how effectively the system's functions are performed.

1. **Performance:**
   - The solution should be able to store the data of up to 25000 users and 2000 pet adoption ads.
   - The maximum page load time should not exceed 3 seconds.
   - The list of announcements should be loaded in less than 5 seconds, with a maximum of 20 announcements per page.

2. **Availability:**
   - The website should be available between 7 AM – 12:00 AM to allow users to access information and interact with announcements.

3. **Integrity:**
   - Information about animals (descriptions, images, etc.) must be accurate and protected against unauthorized modifications.
   - Only the author of the announcement can edit or delete information regarding the announcement.
